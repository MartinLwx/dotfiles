# dotfiles
I agree with the statement - [*Your dotfiles will most likely be the longest project you ever work on.*](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/). That is one of my motivations of creating this repo.

After getting familiar with more and more dotfiles, I also thought I should use Git to manage them :)
